## Malagasy Astronomy Research Group (Astro-Mad)


**Astro-Mad** is supported by a research group of MSc/PhD students and a postdoc hosted under the Astrophysics & Astronomy (AEA) and the University of Antananarivo. The researchers are pioneering both astronomy and cosmology analyses of multiwavelength observations both from ground- and space-based telescopes. We are part of the African Very Long Baselines Interfetometry (VLBI) Network (SKA/AVN) [African partner countries](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science/avn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and we work with the [Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA)](https://www.dara-project.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} project. Please visit our research group website for more details (https://astro-mad.github.io/).
