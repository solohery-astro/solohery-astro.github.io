I do research in galaxy formation and evolution using multi-wavelength data. My main research interests center around the questions of how do distant blue cluster star-forming galaxies (SFGs) evolve in the high density region in clusters, and what are the characteristics and roles of star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the evolution of cluster galaxies at intermediate and high redshift.

Research Interests 
======
Extragalactic astronomy, galaxy formation and evolution. Large scale structure and observational cosmology. Observational radio astronomy, single dish and radio interferometry, and VLBI.


Supervision of Students
======
I have supervised postgraduate students in Astrophysics & Astronomy in the Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences at the University of Antananarivo. 
Below are links to a list of current and past students in Astrophysics (Master II) that Iâ€™ve supervised in the last couple of years.

Postgraduate students
======
* Ny Ando RALITERA, Master (ongoing).
* Francia RAZAFIMANJATO, Master (2022).
* Miora ANDRIATSARALAZA, Master (2018).
* Hajanirina RANDRIAMANANTENA, Master (2017).
